A small Pokemon themed project made using Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars, Sequelize with Sqlite3 and Bootstrap.

Instructions
Create types and regions before attempting to create pokemons, as you have to assign their respective type and region to each one you create.
Deleting a type or a region while a pokemon has it will result in the deletion of both the region/type and the pokemon.
